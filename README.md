Secret Code Generator Using Python


The Python program encodes and decodes messages: 
If a word has at least 3 characters, it shifts the first letter to the end and adds random characters at both ends;otherwise, it reverses the word. 
Decoding reverses the process, handling words with fewer than 3 characters differently.
